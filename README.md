# DBAssignment4
This is the answer of the following assignment by Taeyong Lee

CISC 7510X HW# 4 (due by Nth class;): Write a command line program to "join" .csv files. Use any programming language you're comfortable with. Your program should work similarly to the unix "join" utility (google for it). Unlike the unix join, your program will not require files to be sorted on the key. Your program must also accept the "type" of join to use---merge join, inner loop join, or hash join, etc. Assume that first column is the join key---or you can accept the column number as paramater (like unix join command). Test your program on "large" files (e.g. make sure it doesn't blow up on one million records, etc.)

For this assignment, suppose that key is always first column
